%% Section 2 Problem
% In this problem, you will optimize two codes. The goal is to reduce the running 
% time of each code. You will get points based on the percentage of the running 
% time you have reduced.
% 
% Here are things to look for when optimizing:
% 
% (1) numeric arrays have less memory overhead than structure or cell arrays
% 
% (2) use clear to delete variables no longer needed
% 
% (3) vectorize loops whenever possible
% 
% (4) logical indexing much faster than using find to extract index arrays
% 
% (5) delayed copy can make a huge difference (when large matrix passed to 
% function, don?t unnecessarily modify it) 
% 
% (6) sparse matrices can be much more efficient than full matrices, in terms 
% of both storage and operations. 
% 
% (7) Preallocation of numeric arrays, rather then incrementally growing 
% their size within a loop.
% 
% Some, but not necessarily all of these optimizations will be significant 
% in this problem. MATLAB?s profiler is a useful tool in determining bottlenecks.
%% Task 1
% Optimize the code in |optimize_me.m| and in |optimize_me_too.m|. Profile the 
% code using MATLAB?s profiler before and after optimization.
% 
%  Feel free to use the code box below.

%Write your code here%
%% Task 2
% Run the code before the optimization for 10 times and find the average running 
% time. Run the code after the optimization for 10 times and find the average 
% running time. Find the ratio of the average running time after the optmization 
% and before the optimization. This ratio should be less than 1.
% 
% Feel free to use the box code below.

%% Checkpoint
% Please answer the following questions and put the answers in the EdX page:
% 
% (A) When profiling |optimize_me.m,|on what line of the code is the majority 
% of time spent?
% 
% (B) On line 14 of |optimize_me.m|, the grid is being defined.  Is there 
% a way to vectorize this and write this in one line of code?
% 
% (C) On line 25 of |optimize_me.m,|a difference matrix is created.  Is it 
% possible to use sparse storage instead?
% 
% (D) Line 33 of |optimize_me.m |shows a simple recursion relation between 
% the new value of |U |and its old value.  What is the memory efficient storage 
% of  |U?|
% 
% (E) On what line of |optimize_me_too.m |is a delayed copy being made?
% 
% (F) Think about the linear algebra operation being done on line 33 of |optimize_me.m 
% |and in |optimize_me_too.m. |Give the code expression to eliminate the need 
% of |optimize_me_too.m. |This effectively avoids making a delayed copy and explicitly 
% forming the identity matrix.  Enter your expression in the format |U = x - x*x*x*x.|
% 
% (G) What optimizations were the most significant for |optimize_me.m|? 
% 
% (H) What is the ratio you get from Task 2? Round it to the nearest thousandth.
